- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @zivita, </br>
An architect and product woman, eager to learn about **"developer's happiness"** </br>
I see a correlation between our professions and would love to learn more about: </br>
Why you **love beingÂ a developer? Or what you dislike?** </br>
In the last few months, I've interviewed dozens of developers, </br>
And Im looking for more people who are willing to share and have a short *30-minute video conversation with me*.</br>
I do not care about your professionalÂ âœ¨ levels or experience âœ¨âœ¨  </br> 
If you are open-minded to share your thoughts ðŸ¤¯ </br> write to me here ðŸ’Œ  zivita@gmail.com
